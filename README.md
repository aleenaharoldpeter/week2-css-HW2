## 🧩 Project Overview  
In this project, I created a basic web page styled with CSS to enhance its appearance and structure.  
The repo shows my complete project code and file organization.  
I hosted it on **GitHub Pages** since Replit’s hosting service currently has issues.  

If you are using a **dark mode browser extension**, please disable it while reviewing.  
**Wave WebAIM** may incorrectly flag accessibility issues caused by dark mode — not my code.

## 📂 Project Structure  
This repository includes all files required for the project.  
You can find the stylesheet here:  
`/css/style.css`

---

## 🔍 How to Verify the Styling  
**Option 1:** Open the repo and check `/css/style.css` directly.  
**Option 2:** Open the live website and use  
`CTRL + SHIFT + I` (Windows) or  
Right Click → **Inspect** (All OS)  
to view applied CSS rules for each section.

## 🧠 Assignment Steps Implemented  
- Added a working “Skip to Main Content” link.  
- Commented out the original `li` styling.  
- Set the `nav` element to `inline-block` with a width of 80%.  
- Styled only the image in `nav` to have 10% width (with `position: relative; top: 20px;`).  
- Used a two-column grid layout (`grid-template-columns: 40% 40%`).  
- Ensured images in the grid take up 100% width using a descendant selector.  
- Styled the `.flex` class with `display: flex`, adjusting wrapping and spacing to match the example.
